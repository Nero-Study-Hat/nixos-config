Some of the below host folders have a setup-scripts folder within them for install and post-install scripts to run.

- stardom is my desktop PC

- stardom-vm is a vm version of my desktop pc config for testing off device and easier sharing
    - the only differences are the hardware-config (things like graphics acceleration, etc.), setup scripts, and not supporting virtualization

- isoimage is a live system meant for installation and possibly recovery activity

- minimal test systems folder is for hosts focused on isolating one issue I am having so
    - I can share this host for others to test and tinker with
